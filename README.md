# ToDo (v1.0-beta) Desktop Application

## Overview
ToDo is a basic and simple desktop application built using Java Swing. It allows users to add tasks and delete them as needed.

## Features
- Add new tasks to the list
- Delete tasks from the list

## Installation
1. Download the ToDoAppSetup.exe file from Releases.
2. Run the setup file to install the application.
3. During installation, choose a directory other than the C drive (e.g., D drive, Documents, Desktop, or any other folder except Program Files and Program Files x86).
   Note: This is because the application creates a task.txt file to store tasks, and Windows may deny access to files in certain directories.

## Usage
1. Launch the ToDo application after installation.
2. Use the "Add Task" button to add new tasks to the list.
3. To delete a task, select it from the list and click the "Delete Task" button.

## Note
While installing the application, choose a directory other than the C drive due to access restrictions imposed by Windows for files created by the application.
